## Trigger Rofi on Gnome with the Overview key.

### Installation
Copy the folder `rofi-on-gnome@sayan505` to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

##### Small warning: This is a makeshift extension written for my own use. This may break your Overview toggle unless you disable it and restart the session on odd Gnome versions.
